# Menu Insurance


This is a proof-of-concept life insurance quote website based on a menu of choices of various risk coverage. 
The purpose is to do UX testing.
Users fill up their personal particulars, and can go on to select the insurance coverage they would like for a quote (eg. death cover).



Two menu formats are explored:

- Menu 1 allows the user to go through a series of forms to select the risk covers. 
The last panel shows the premium payable for the next year for the risk cover selected.

- Menu 2 shows all the risk covers on one page with the premium payable at the bottom.

Premium rates are dynamic and change, depending on the amount of sum assureds selected. 
Menu 1 and 2 selections are separate and not related.


Further explorations:
- Which menu option provides a better user experience?
- How could we capture a client's needs before we begin the quotation 
- Given that the terms are different between different risk covers, does the premium represent a 'levelised' rate?
Or risk premium for the next year?
- What are the implications for this difference? (eg. assumption setting)
